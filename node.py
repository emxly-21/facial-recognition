            neighbors : Sequence[int]
                The node-IDs of the neighbors of this node.

            descriptor : numpy.ndarray
                The (128,) descriptor vector for this node's picture

            truth : Optional[str]
                If you have truth data, for checking your clustering algorithm,
                you can include the label to check your clusters at the end.

                If this node corresponds to a picture of Ryan, this truth
                value can just be "Ryan"

            file_path : Optional[str]
                The file path of the image corresponding to this node, so
