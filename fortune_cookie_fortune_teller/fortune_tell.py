def train_lm(text_lst, n):
    """ Train character-based n-gram language model.

    This will learn: given a sequence of n-1 characters, what the probability
    distribution is for the n-th character in the sequence.

    For example if we train on the text:
        text = "cacao"

    Using a n-gram size of n=3, then the following dict would be returned.
    See that we *normalize* each of the counts for a given history

        {'ac': [('a', 1.0)],
         'ca': [('c', 0.5), ('o', 0.5)],
         '~c': [('a', 1.0)],
         '~~': [('c', 1.0)]}

    Tildas ("~") are used for padding the history when necessary, so that it's
    possible to estimate the probability of a seeing a character when there
    aren't (n - 1) previous characters of history available.

    So, according to this text we trained on, if you see the sequence 'ac',
    our model predicts that the next character should be 'a' 100% of the time.

    For generating the padding, recall that Python allows you to generate
    repeated sequences easily:
       `"p" * 4` returns `"pppp"`

    Parameters
    -----------
    text_lst: str list
        A string (doesn't need to be lowercased).
    n: int
        The length of n-gram to analyze.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict[str, List[Tuple[str, float]]]
      {n-1 history -> [(letter, normalized count), ...]}
    A dict that maps histories (strings of length (n-1)) to lists of (char, prob)
    pairs, where prob is the probability (i.e frequency) of char appearing after
    that specific history.

    Examples
    --------
    #>>> train_lm("cacao", 3)
    {'ac': [('a', 1.0)],
     'ca': [('c', 0.5), ('o', 0.5)],
